          As a developer on the team (Fall 2021 - Spring 2022), I worked on two
          main software features for Minibot, both of them relating to computer
          vision and utilizing Apriltags. The first project (Fall 2021) was an
          overhead vision system used to track the position of the Minibot for
          later use in path planning algorithms and more. This was my first
          Computer Vision project, but I learned a lot from the three other
          developers I worked with on the project. Then, I started a new project
          (Spring 2022) with one other developer called Physical Blockly. The
          project utilized Apriltags on physical blocks to create a physical
          programming language for the Minibot platform. My work focused on
          generating Google's Blockly blocks and either executing them on the
          robot or sending them over to the web based basestation for the robot
          (using React) and building up a small program to run later.

          I was chosen to be the Minibot CS lead for the Minibot project (Fall
          2022 - Fall 2024), where I was the main driver for system
          architecture, new features, as well as cross team communication. I
          planned features, worked closely with newer devs, and ensured smooth
          integration across software subsystems. I was involved in every
          subsystem of Minibot, including the Chatbot, where I pushed for
          integration with LLMs, the computer vision projects, as well as
          updating the Physical Blockly project to use RFID tags instead of a
          camera based Apriltag system. Starting Fall 2023, the team as a whole
          decided to migrate from the old Minibot platform and switch to
          building software and hardware attachments to an existing modular
          robotics platform. After extensive research into options, the team
          chose the Experiential Robotics Platform (XRP) by Sparkfun. From
          there, I spearheaded migration of software systems to support totally
          new physical architecture, migrating from a setup involving a
          Raspberry Pi and multiple Arduinos, to using the ESP32 and a Raspberry
          Pi Zero for onboard vision.

          As Team Lead (Spring 2024 - Spring 2024), I oversaw development for

          coordination, long-term planning, and ensuring communication across
          CS, MechE, and ECE teams. When not running scrum meetings and helping
          to set goals and deadlines for all three robotics projects, I bounced
          around helping teams that were running behind. This involved assisting
          with Unity and VR integration, planning for SPI communication
          protocols, communication between ESP32 and laptops over the network,
          and more.
